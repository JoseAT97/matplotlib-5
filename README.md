# Overview
This project analyzes the effects of various drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. The dataset includes metadata and study results for a series of trials performed by the pharmaceutical company Pymaceuticals Inc. The goal is to investigate how different treatments affected tumor size, identify potential outliers, and visualize key summary statistics.

# Visualizations
Bar charts: Showing the total number of measurements for each drug regimen.

Box plots: Illustrating the distribution of tumor volumes per treatment.

Line plots: Tracking tumor volume over time for individual mice.

Scatter plot with regression: Revealing correlation between weight and tumor volume.

# Conclusion
The study provides useful insights into the relative efficacy of various cancer drugs tested on mice. Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most promising candidates for further research due to their consistent tumor reduction performance. The correlation between weight and tumor volume may also be valuable for dosing considerations.
